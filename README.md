# 🧠 SQL Data Warehouse Project (ETL + Modeling + Architecture)

Welcome to my SQL Data Warehouse Project! 🚀
This repository showcases a full end-to-end Data Warehouse built from scratch — including ETL development, data modeling, architecture design, and clean repository structuring.

The project is designed as a practical portfolio piece to demonstrate real-world data engineering practices using only SQL Server.

# 🏗 Medallion Data Architecture

This Data Warehouse follows the Medallion Architecture, organizing data into three structured layers:

![High-Level Architecture](docs/data_architecture.png)
---

## 1. Bronze Layer – Raw Data Ingestion

- Ingests and stores raw data as-is from source systems (CRM & ERP) into the SQL Server database using automated load scripts.


## 2. Silver Layer – Transformation & Standardization

- Cleans, standardizes, normalizes and enriches data to ensure consistency and quality.
- Applies business rules and validation logic, with error handling & logging for ETL monitoring 
  

## 3. Gold Layer – Business-Ready Data Model

- Builds fact and dimension tables following a star schema
- Produces business-ready, analytics-ready datasets optimized for reporting

# ⚙️ Project Overview
1. **Data Architecture**: Designing a modern Data Warehouse using the Medallion architecture with **Bronze, Silver** and **Gold** layers.
2. **ETL Pipeline**: Implementing an end-to-end ETL pipeline to extract, transform and load data from source systems into the arehouse
3. **Data Modeling**: Building fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries & reporting

# 🔮 Future Improvements

This project will be re-implemented using:

- Python – For ETL transformations and data manipulation  
- Apache Airflow – To automate and orchestrate ETL pipelines  

The goal is to build a fully orchestrated, automated modern data pipeline with better scheduling, monitoring, and scalability.
